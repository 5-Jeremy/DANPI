Dynamic Audio Normalization Parallel Implementation, my final project for a GPU computing and programming course

The file Jeremy-Carleton-Report.pdf contains a complete description of the software, details for how to run it (including a link to a video demonstration), and a performance analysis. This program uses CUDA C++, and thus is intended to be run on computers with NVIDIA GPUs (see section 4.1 of the report).
